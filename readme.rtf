This project is the final assessment I did to pass the Advanced Data Visualization course. 
I collected all the necessary data from the website, and imported them to the Tableau desktop. 
I also created the final dashboard to tell the story about the reason I chose the 2019 Honda CR-V LX AWD as the best option for the company car purchasing.
